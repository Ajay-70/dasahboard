# Full-Stack Project: Vue.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL

Welcome to our full-stack project! This application combines Vue.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL for the database. It is a comprehensive solution that leverages the strengths of each technology to create a powerful and dynamic web application.

## Project Overview

### Frontend (Vue.js)

The frontend is developed using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive user interface. Vue.js provides a flexible and efficient development experience, ensuring a smooth and engaging user interaction.

### Backend (Spring Boot)

The backend of our application is powered by Spring Boot, a robust Java-based framework. It handles server-side logic, integrates with the database, and exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the frontend. Spring Boot simplifies the development process, offering a convention-over-configuration approach and strong dependency injection.

### Database (MySQL)

MySQL is employed as the relational database management system, storing and retrieving data for our application. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing the project's data requirements.
